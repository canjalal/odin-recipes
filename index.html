    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Odin, King of Asgard was a connoisseur of spices.
        He discovered this when he was exploring Midgard. Although he set up a humble abode
        in Scandinavia, he enjoyed the rich coriander, cumin, caraway, cardamom, chilis,
        cinnamon, and capsicum. Traveling in the various areas of the British Raj in the
        New Imperialist era, he compiled this list of recipes. The first recipe he compiled
        was one for <a href="recipes/chanadal.html">chana dal</a>.</p>
