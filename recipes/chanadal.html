    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a famous dish that Odin enjoyed while Frigga was pregnant with Thor.
        He would make it for the whole family and Frigga would have a double helping of it.
        Its main ingredient is chana dal, which are split chickpeas. It gets its color
        from turmeric. It is served with garlic, onions, tomatos, and some recommended powders
        are garam masala and amchur power, and a pinch of asafetida and ground coriander.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp garam masala powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp amchur powder</li>
        <li>&frac14; tsp asafetida</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coriander powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, rinse 4 cups of chana dal (split chickpeas) in running water for a couple of times. Drain thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Place the lentils in a bowl. Then cover with water and soak the chana dal for one hour. For a quicker method, soak the lentils in hot water (not boiling!) for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>When done soaking, drain the water.</li>
        <li>Add the chana dal to your pressure cooker or Instant Pot, along with 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder.</li>
        <li>Now add about 5 to 6 cups water in a 10 litre stovetop pressure cooker. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook the chana dal for about 10 to 11 minutes, or 7 to 8 whistles, on a high heat in a stove-top pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Allow the cooker or Instant Pot to do a complete natural pressure release before unsealing the lid – this means to let the pressure fall naturally in the stovetop cooker or Instant pot.
        <br /> <br />
            Check the lentils for doneness – they should be very soft and easy to mush with the back of a spoon. Cover the pot and set aside.
            <br /> <br />
            If the lentils are undercooked, pressure cook again for some more minutes until they are softened.</li>
        <li>Next, heat 5 tablespoons of oil or ghee in a large pan on the stovetop on medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of cumin seeds and fry for a few seconds, until they crackle and sizzle.</li>
        <li> Now add 4 or 5 finely chopped garlic cloves, about 2 teaspoons.</li>
        <li>Fry until the garlic is light golden.</li>
        <li>Now add a cup of chopped onions.</li>
        <li>Stir and saut&eacute;.</li>
        <li>Continue to saut&eacute; the onions until golden.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of chopped tomatoes (2 or 3 large tomatoes) to the pan.</li>
        <li>Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of finely chopped ginger and 2 teaspoons of finely chopped green chilies.</li>
        <li>Then add all the dried spices.</li>
        <li>Mix and continue to saut&eacute;.</li>
        <li>Cook until the tomatoes are softened and the oil starts to leave the side of the masala mixture.</li>
        <li>Next, add the cooked chana dal along with its stock to the pan. Or, add the saut&eacute;ed masala mixture to the cooked dal if you have used Instant pot for cooking the lentils.</li>
        <li>Stir very well. Mash some lentils with the spoon as you go on stirring. Mashing some lentils helps the dal to thicken.
            <br /> <br />
        If the dal looks a bit too thick, add about 1 cup of water or more, and stir. Continue to add water and stir until the consistency is somewhere like a curry saucy and with medium to medium-thick consistency but loose and pourable.</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Either on the stovetop or using the saut&eacute; Instant Pot function, cook the dal for another 6 to 8 minutes or more. This should help the chana dal thicken up a bit and really combine the flavors well.
            <br /><br />
            If serving chana dal with roti or naan, then you can might want to prepare it with a slightly thicker consistency for scooping.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy homemade chana dal with roti, steamed basmati rice, cumin rice or Saffron Rice. It’s also great with a side of raita, a fresh green salad or nearly any vegetable dish.</li>
